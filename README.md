  <h3 align="center">LeManchot-VT-Smart</h3>

  <p align="center">
	The VT Smart subsystem of the LeManchot platform provides the required tools for fusion of thermal and visivle modalities. Also it provides the required features to detect the defects and abnormalities using both modalities.

## Experiments

### Case Study 1 : ULAVAL Road Inspection:
- We are going to use coupled thermal and visible images for inspection of pavement roads.
- Since the drone's altitude is static for each data session, we will use the GCP placed at begining of each session to determine the parameters for modality registration.
**OBJECTIVES**: We will use the visible image to segment vegetation and pavement in visible images, then use these blobs to segment thermal images.

### Case Study 2 : Piping Inspection
- We are going to use coupled thermal and visible images for piping inspection.
**OBJECTIVE**: (a) Fusion of thermal and visible images, (b) Distinguish normal and abnormal defects for industrial inspection.

### Case Study 3 : Bridge Inspection
- We are going to use coupled thermal and visible images for bridge inspection.
**OBJECTIVE**: (a) Registration of thermal and visible images, (b) Extract concrete areas from thermal images using segmentation of visible images.
